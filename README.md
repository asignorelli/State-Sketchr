## 🎮 How to Play  
1. Choose a mode from the **Main Menu**:  
   - **Random State** → Guess one state at random.  
   - **Pick a State** → Select a specific state to play.  
   - **Try All 50** → Challenge yourself with every state in sequence.  
2. On the **Game Screen**, you’ll be shown the **name of a state** and given a limited time to sketch it on the canvas.  
3. When the timer ends, the **Results Screen** compares your sketch with the official **SVG reference outline** of that state.  
   - A **lenient pixel comparison** gives you a percentage score for how close your drawing is.  
   - See your sketch side-by-side with the real state outline.
